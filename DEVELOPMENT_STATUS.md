## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
None currently reported.

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **7Z extraction overhead**: 7Z files extracted to temp (see GAPS.md)
2. **Large file memory usage**: Files loaded entirely into memory (see GAPS.md)
3. **Limited CI platforms**: Only Linux CI currently active
4. **GUI test coverage**: No automated GUI tests

### Performance Considerations

1. **Single-threaded hashing**: ~3GB/s limit (parallel implementation in progress)
2. **Memory scaling**: ~100-200 bytes per file (optimizations planned)
3. **Network filesystem**: Performance varies by filesystem type
